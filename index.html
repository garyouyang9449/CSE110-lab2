          <p>
            I am currently a Junior studying <span>Math - Computer Science at UC San Diego</span>. My background is 
            primarily in backend development, and I have experience in different programming languages,
            including Java, Python, C, C++, and SQL. I also have experience working with Amazon web 
            services. Last summer, I worked as a software engineer intern at a startup, where 
            I wrote and deployed Node.js async backend code and Serverless via AWS Lambda to train a 
            recommending system. I am currently working as an undergraduate researcher/Software Engineer 
            within the Paesani Research Group under Professor Francesco Paesani. My main responsibility is to 
            design and create extrapolation systems for computational chemistry. I am also working as a Part-Time Software Engineer Intern 
            at HouseCall Pro. Recently, I developed an interest and self study in data science. In my recent project financial dataset, 
            I want to create a dataset that allows the user to have quick access to financial data, and I am planning to develop an api 
            to allow user query financial data.
